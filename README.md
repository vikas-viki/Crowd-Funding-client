# Crowd Funding

I just have created a complete Crowd Funding **dapp**.

🤔 where it implements the same functionalities of normal - Crowd funding (where everyone donate their money for a person/group of people who is/are in need of it for a particular purpose.)

But here it solves the problem of having a Centralized authority, by using Solidity for writing Smart contract, which is decentralized where no one change it even a person who deployed it into blockchain 😀.

I have also created a detailed video explaining, how you can implement it in Solidity in a beginner level manner on YouTube in Hindi.

Thankyou for being with me till here 👍. If it seems helpful make sure to share with one who is in need of it 🤗.

**Steps to use :**

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

- Run `npm run dev` to run it locally.

All the functionalities are tested, you can see it [here.](https://github.com/vikas-viki/Crowd-Funding-solidity)
